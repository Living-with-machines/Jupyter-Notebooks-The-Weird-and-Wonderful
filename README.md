# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks: the weird and the wonderful 
(British Library "hack and yack" workshop) 

### Aims 

Depending on your starting point you may focus only on a particular aim during this session:

- Understand what a Jupyter notebook is and why they are used 
- How to (try) running notebooks someone else has created
- Introduce some weird stuff you can do with notebooks

### Session format 



## What is a Jupyter notebook?

If you don't know what a Jupyter notebook is or are only vaguely familiar you may want to start working through some of these resources:

- [The offical Jupyter page](https://jupyter.org/)
https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks#literate-computing 
What is Jupyter Notebook? Youtube https://youtu.be/q_BzsPxwLOE 

### Why are notebook used? 

- Programming / exploratory data analysis 
- Research process
- Teaching material 



## How to try running notebooks someone else has created?
What and why?

Some considerations:
- Where is the code going to be run - your computer or someone elseâ€™s computer?
- Data required by the notebook and how to get this into your environment 
- Python packages you will require 
- Non-python packages expected by the notebook (e.g. TIFFLib)
- Compute requirements of the code your running 

### Running on someone else's computer 

#### Google colab 
#### Binder
