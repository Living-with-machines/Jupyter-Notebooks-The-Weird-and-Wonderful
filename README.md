# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks: the weird and the wonderful 
(British Library "hack and yack" workshop) 

### Aims 

Depending on your starting point you may focus only on a particular aim during this session:

- Understand what a Jupyter notebook is and why they are used 
- How to (try) running notebooks someone else has created
- Introduce some weird stuff you can do with notebooks

### Session format 



## What is a Jupyter notebook?

If you don't know what a Jupyter notebook is or are only vaguely familiar you may want to start working through some of these resources:

- [The offical Jupyter page](https://jupyter.org/)
- [The official documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
- [A Programming Historian lesson (focus on the literate computing section)](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks#literate-computing)
- What is Jupyter Notebook? [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/q_BzsPxwLOE)


## How to try running notebooks someone else has created?

Since notebook are being used increasingly to document researhc processes, demonstrate how to use tools and APIs and as a way of creating trainign material it can often be useful to be able to run a notebook someone else has created. The difficulty of doing this ranges from easy to impossible. We'll look a little bit at some of the considerations in more detail in a moment. 

### What is a notebook?

This might seem like repetition when this is covered in the previous section but let's look at what a Jupyter notebook *really* is.



(here we mean just the notebook, not the ecosystem of infasturrecuter around a notebook tha you'll often work with). 



Some considerations:
- Where is the code going to be run - your computer or someone elseâ€™s computer?
- Data required by the notebook and how to get this into your environment 
- Python packages you will require 
- Non-python packages expected by the notebook (e.g. TIFFLib)
- Compute requirements of the code your running 

### Running on someone else's computer 

#### Google colab 
#### Binder
